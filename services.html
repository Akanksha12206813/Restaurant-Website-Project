            <h2 class="h-secondary center">Designated Smoking Zone</h2>
            <p class="center">It is quite common to find resturants and cafes where smoking isn't allowed at all. When 
                smokers feel like taking a few puffs, they have to either go out of the resturant or wait till everyone
                with them finishes the meal. At Afra Tafri, we have designed a separate smoking zone keeping this 
                challenge in mind. Now you can smoke freely in the designated smoking area without affecting the 
                experience of other patrons. Those who prefer smoking alone will also find the area suitable. Note:
                we aren't encouraging the consumption of tobacco through our smoking zone. The aim was to have a 
                separate place for smokers in the resturants so that other guests remain unaffected due to passive 
                smoking.
